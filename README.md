A simple word-guessing game I'm working on! :)

Hello! Welcome to my little project, a word guessing game, were you have 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word either letter by letter, or the whole word at once!

I'm currently still developing it, with a few ideas for expansions and things I can add to it, and overall still fixing bugs and learning new things! 

For now, I've divided my project in a few separate .py files for different functions, a few .txt files for annotations and one for a list of words the game uses. To play the game, just run the play_me.py file.

Thank you for reading and please feel free to leave any comments and suggestions! ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
